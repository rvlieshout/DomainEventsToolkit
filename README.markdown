# DomainEventsToolkit is no longer developed

This is my personal fork, as some project (written many moons ago) is using this library, but it was pulled from NuGet.

## Introduction

DomainEventsToolkit is a light and easy to use .net 4 library for implementing the Domain Events architectural pattern. This library will make it easier to apply the Domain Events pattern without static classes in a TDD friendly way.

### Getting Started

*  ~~Install it via Nugget https://nuget.org/packages/DomainEventsToolkit~~
*  ~~See the Wiki for examples :)~~

*  Look for some other project or write your own.
